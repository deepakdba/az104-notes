- proximity placement of vm scale set should be in RG of same location
- you cant view resouce creation date from subscriptoion blade  and click resource provider
- you cant view resouce creation date from RG blade and automation script
- you cant view resouce creation date from RG blade and deployments button
- you can monitoe vm metrics and logs using linux dianostic extension LAD 3.0
- Rule2 blocks ports 50-60, which includes port 53, the DNS port. Internet users can reach to the Web server,
since it uses port 80. If Rule2 is removed internet users can reach the DNS server as well.
- Use availability zones to protect from datacenter level failures.
- you could configure RG when deploy a vm using template from RM linrarry
- Modify the VM size property of VM1, can be created as task create a scheduled runbook to increase the processor performance of VM1 at the end of each month.
- DSC extension to use when to ensure NGINX is available to all vm after they deolyed.
- in AKS cluster, container will be assinged ip in POD cidr, AKScluster will be assign IP from service cidr
- 70% for 1h, and then 90% for 5 minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will scale out out 1 more. So, 2 in total.
Box 2: 4
90% for 1h and then 25% for 9minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will it scale in to the max 5 (60/5 = 12, which
means 6 times scale out, because we have 5 minutes period of cool down). Then when it drops to 25% for 9
minutes and it will scale in once after 5 mins (since the average of the last 5 minutes is under 30% ), so it will
decrease by 1, so 4 in total. Then it will have a cooldown of 5 minutes before scaling in again, but since only 4
minutes left from 9 minutes (9-5 = 4), it won't scale in again. So, 4 in total.
- For Windows Server, the temporary disk is mounted as “D:\”. and so changes will be lost after reploy
- If you resize the Scale Set all the VMs get resized at once, thus 4 is the correct answer. Automatic OS updates update 20% of the VMs at once, with a minimum of 1 VM instance at a time. Also 20%
of 4 = 0.8.
