- proximity placement of vm scale set should be in RG of same location
- you cant view resouce creation date from subscriptoion blade  and click resource provider
- you cant view resouce creation date from RG blade and automation script
- you cant view resouce creation date from RG blade and deployments button
- you can monitoe vm metrics and logs using linux dianostic extension LAD 3.0
- Rule2 blocks ports 50-60, which includes port 53, the DNS port. Internet users can reach to the Web server,
since it uses port 80. If Rule2 is removed internet users can reach the DNS server as well.
- Use availability zones to protect from datacenter level failures.
- you could configure RG when deploy a vm using template from RM linrarry
- Modify the VM size property of VM1, can be created as task create a scheduled runbook to increase the processor performance of VM1 at the end of each month.
- DSC extension to use when to ensure NGINX is available to all vm after they deolyed.
- in AKS cluster, container will be assinged ip in POD cidr, AKScluster will be assign IP from service cidr
- 70% for 1h, and then 90% for 5 minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will scale out out 1 more. So, 2 in total.
Box 2: 4
90% for 1h and then 25% for 9minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will it scale in to the max 5 (60/5 = 12, which
means 6 times scale out, because we have 5 minutes period of cool down). Then when it drops to 25% for 9
minutes and it will scale in once after 5 mins (since the average of the last 5 minutes is under 30% ), so it will
decrease by 1, so 4 in total. Then it will have a cooldown of 5 minutes before scaling in again, but since only 4
minutes left from 9 minutes (9-5 = 4), it won't scale in again. So, 4 in total.
- For Windows Server, the temporary disk is mounted as “D:\”. and so changes will be lost after reploy
- If you resize the Scale Set all the VMs get resized at once, thus 4 is the correct answer. Automatic OS updates update 20% of the VMs at once, with a minimum of 1 VM instance at a time. Also 20%
of 4 = 0.8.
- swap the slots if we need to revert to the previous version of App1 as quickly as possible.
- VM1 is affected by ransomware that encrypts data.
You need to restore the latest backup of VM1.
To which location can you restore the backup -->VM1 or new azure VM machine only
Can perform file recovey of vm1 to --> any windows computer that has internet connectivity
- If VM1 does not have the latest version of the Azure VM Agent (WaAppAgent.exe) installed, backup warning status could be deplyed
- You receive a notification that VM1 will be affected by maintenance. you need to move VM1 to a different host immediately. --> moveing to different RG is not sufficient; you need to redeploy the VM
- platform FaultDomain Count be 3 (since its in East US, Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
- Alerts in Azure Monitor can identify important information in your Log Analytics repository. They are created
by alert rules that automatically run log searches at regular intervals, and if results of the log search match
particular criteria, then an alert record is created and it can be configured to perform an automated response.
The Log Analytics agent collects monitoring data from the guest operating system and workloads of virtual
machines in Azure, other cloud providers, and on- premises. It collects data into a Log Analytics workspace.

- New-AzResourceGroupDeployment.
This cmdlet allows you to use a custom ARM template file to deploy resources to a resource group. For
example:
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location "$location"
ResourceGroupName RG1.
It’s one of parameters of New-AzResourceGroupDeployment to specify to which resource group you want to
deploy resources.
You could use New-AzVm to create a VM, but it doesn’t use a template. You would need to provide all
parameters in the command line.

- To deploy a YAML file, the command is:
kubectl apply -f <file_name>.yaml

- Install the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent on new VM if want to restore backup to different VM
- From th RG blsfr er vsn view which tyemplate was used for the development.
- In order to revert the previous version of app a azure web appp quickly, the best way is to swap the slots.
- File recovery from a VM could be done to any windows computer that has internet connectivity and we could restore VM1 to VM1 or newazure VM only.
- Warning status in backup re-check status suggests that VM1 does not have latest version od azure vm agent waappagent.exe installed
- Platform faultdomain domain count to match with region fault domain count, platform update domain count maximum is 20
- New-AzResourceGroupDeployment cmdlet is  to use to acustom arm template file to deploy resources to a
